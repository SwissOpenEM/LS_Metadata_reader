# Metadata extractors
simple parser for the two common life-science EM metadata output formats, written in python

## Comments
Runs on a directory containing raw files and their instrument written additional information files (.mdoc and .xml respectively), generates a dataset level .json file in that directory.

## TODO

- might add another function for .json written by Athena for Tomo5
- add lookup tables to consolidate into one schema for upload to scicat
